<p>At the end of my junior year of high school they gathered a limited group of students (not sure how they determined who got to be in the group) to discuss a new course offering, AP computer science. I was intrigued though really not sure what computer science was, even after this meeting. I had a vague notion of what programming was but no one in my life was a programmer or software engineer so I had not really been exposed to it. Nevertheless, I signed up for the class.</p>

<p>Most of the work we did in the class revolved around Karl J Robot. Big daddy Karl was a robot that lived on a grid and you controlled Karl‚Äôs movements by calling functions like turnLeft, turnRight, and moveForward. Karl J was supposed to be an easy introduction to object oriented programming but I remember being very confused about how Karl actually worked. Not how to move Karl around the grid. That was painfully easy. But how did Karl‚Äôs image and the grid get rendered on the screen? What was happening when you called the function moveForward and how was that connected to the Karl J sprite? Where was Karl‚Äôs current state stored? I didn‚Äôt even know enough about object oriented programming to formulate these questions. If we had dived into these topics I would have been much more interested but my conception of programming was that I could make Karl move around the grid and not much else, which seemed pretty useless.</p>

<p>One exercise we did that was unrelated to Mr. Karl J Robot was taking an integer and printing the individual digits (not sure what order so lets say from least to most significant). At the time I thought this was a pretty tough challenge but I was able to solve it. Today my solution would look something like this.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not actually sure if we learned about the modulus operator because I just remember using integer division which has truncation to get the values I wanted. It‚Äôs possible we did learn modulus and I just didn‚Äôt see how modulus could be used to solve this easily. Back then my code may have looked like this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import java.util.Scanner;
public class NoobPrintDigits {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		while (n != 0) {
			int a = n / 10;
			System.out.println(n - (a * 10));
			n = a;
		}
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Honestly I am sure it was much worse than this but I can‚Äôt bring myself to un-optimize it further. I probably used a lot more unnecessary divisions and bad indentation. I left out the line that closes the scanner because there‚Äôs no way I did that back in the day.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that as a result of this class I fell in love with programming and realized its true power and potential but I really cannot. I don‚Äôt want to blame it entirely on the class ‚Äî I certainly could have taken the class more seriously and I definitely was exposed to enough concepts and ideas that I could have gone off on my own and really learned how to program ‚Äî but with hindsight it is clear to me this class was taught very poorly. It is not that surprising given the fact that this was the first year the course was offered at my school, the teacher had very little programming experience, and the experience he did have was in Visual Basic many years before. I had a lot of friends in this class, it was at the end of the day, and there were very few days where the teacher actually had a lesson planned so the class kind of felt like a social hour. I actually really enjoyed the class because it was low stress and I got to talk to a lot of my nerdy friends but unfortunately I did not learn much about programming.</p>

<p>In the weeks before the AP exam it became clear that I was woefully underprepared and I remember I spent one or two evenings just reading the textbook straight through without doing any exercises. This is absolutely not the best way to learn but I will say it was eye opening to read the text book for the first time and this was maybe my first glimpse at what programming actually was. I can recall coming back to my classmates after my long foray into the fundamentals of Java programming and claiming the programming was actually super interesting and amazing. To be clear we had not used the text book at all.</p>

<p>That pretty much sums up my first year of programming! A bit underwhelming, I know. But very soon fledgling (/ÀàflejliNG/ noun - a young bird that had just fledged.) Duncan would discover how awesome programming actually is üòÅ.</p>
