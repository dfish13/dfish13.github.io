<p>At the end of my junior year of high school they gathered a limited group of students (not sure how they determined who got to be in the group) to discuss a new course offering, AP computer science. I was intrigued though really not sure what computer science was, even after this meeting. I had a vague notion of what programming was but no one in my life was a programmer or software engineer so I had not really been exposed to it. Nevertheless, I signed up for the class.</p>
