I"¨<p>I have a lot of time on my hands at the moment so I figured I should work on my personal website/blog.</p>

<p>I am using a static website generator called Jekyll because it is simple to use and I donâ€™t plan on having dynamic content on this page. The nice part about using Jekyll is that I can host this site on github pages for free with hopefully many 9â€™s of uptime. I will just link to my projects that have dynamic content, like <a href="https://d16mc0nsndq3dv.cloudfront.net/">Cheap Blue</a>. The host server for those projects is likely to change or even go down completely if I decide to stop paying for cloud servers. And if I decide to make my own server you better believe that puppy is gonna be going down all the time. The point is I think it will be good to separate the static and dynamic content so people can still read my blog stuff and get some information about me even when my projects are not running.</p>
