<p>The project I am most proud of is my chess engine, <a href="https://d16mc0nsndq3dv.cloudfront.net/">Cheap Blue</a>. I am continuing to work on and improve it. At some point maybe it will be able to compete with the big boys like Stockfish and Lc0 (Leela chess zero)!</p>

<p>This project originated back when I was in an undergraduate software engineering class. The class was centered around a semester-long group project. In the beginning of the semester everyone had to come up with ideas for a project and then people would join your team if they liked your idea. I was pretty excited about my idea having just watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/TWEXCYQKyDc">YouTube video</a> about steganography so I was able to get people to join me. We ended up with a team of eight people, by far the biggest group project I was involved in during school. The project involved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a> so we decided to name it Stega-saurus.. hilarious I know. Because it was originally my idea and I genuinely cared a lot about making something cool, I was very involved. I was pretty much solely responsible for the backend code to do the steganography and also worked on some of the database and web framework stuff. We used <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/">Django</a> and I remember it being very frustrating dealing with binary file objects and storing them in the database.</p>

<p>Sadly, the only variety of steganography we implemented was LSB substition with PNG images even though we were conscious of a few others, including the one discussed in the Computerphile video I linked above: JPEG steganography using DCT. After the semester was finished I still had an interest in steganography, and I especially wanted to try an implement one method that used GIF images as a cover. I read about this method in a presentation I found online and, as far as I knew, it was just a theoretical idea that no one had tried to implement so I thought it would be a great opportunity to create something new and open source. I didnâ€™t get around to doing it until after I graduated but I finally did and called it <a href="https://github.com/dfish13/Stegasaurus2">Stegasaurus 2</a> to differentiate it from the original project.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other varieties of steganography using all types of media and I would love to continuing adding to this library. I think it would be really cool to do something similar for the HEIC/HEVC image file format that already exists for JPEG images. It would likely involve a lot of research and effort but because this file format is highly relevant there is a high chance the software would actually be used. Also an easier addition to the library would be a method using an audio file format like WAV as a cover.</p>
