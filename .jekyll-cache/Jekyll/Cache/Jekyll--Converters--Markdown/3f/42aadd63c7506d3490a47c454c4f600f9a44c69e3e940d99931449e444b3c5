<p>The project I am most proud of is my chess engine, <a href="https://d16mc0nsndq3dv.cloudfront.net/">Cheap Blue</a>. I am continuing to work on and improve it. At some point maybe it will be able to compete with the big boys like Stockfish and Lc0 (Leela chess zero)!</p>

<p>First I will explain the name. The project involved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a> so we decided to name it Stega-saurus.. hilarious.</p>

<p>This project originated back when I was in an undergraduate software engineering class. The class was centered around a semester-long group project. In the beginning of the semester everyone had to come up with ideas for a project and then people would join your team if they liked your idea. I was pretty excited about my idea having just watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/TWEXCYQKyDc">YouTube video</a> about steganography so I was able to get people to join me. We ended up with a team of eight people, by far the biggest group project I was involved in during school. Because it was originally my idea and I genuinely cared a lot about making something cool, I was very involved. I was pretty much solely responsible for the backend code to do the steganography and also worked on some of the database and web framework stuff. We used <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/">Django</a> and I remember it being very frustrating dealing with binary file objects and storing them in the database.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only variety of steganography we (or I) implemented was LSB substition with PNG images even though we were conscious of a few others, including the one discussed in the Computerphile video I linked above, JPEG steganography using DCT.</p>
